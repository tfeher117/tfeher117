- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tfeher117
I have an MSc in Computer Sciences, I worked with C/C++ before, but for 20 years now I have been working as an Oracle Developer, DBA, Consultant.
I am looking for some C/C++ projects to get back what I had years ago. Developing, bug fixing, I'm interested in any kind of work.
